Skyflow Command Line is an environment manager for your projects.
It provides a Docker manager for all your environments, with pre-configured packages, docker-compose management and commands to run and stop your containers. 
You will no longer search for docker-compose templates on the internet, you will directly add the technologies you need in one command, answer configuration questions and start working on your projects.
